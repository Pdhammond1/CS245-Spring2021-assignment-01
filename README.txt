First, I apologize for the late submission I know the deadline has already been extended and I have been late on other assignments as well. I recently have 
underwent a procedure on my left knee, on March 3rd, and I have definitely been distracted as a result. Also, I was having a few problems with excel, as I have 
never used Excel to make graphs and collect data before. We can talk more about it all over Zoom if you would like but I hope I can still receive feedback 
on this assignment. 

For the modified Quicksort I chose Insertion sort as my quadratic sort because in the first part of the assignment I noticed insertion sort ran more
efficiently than the Bubble/Selection sorts, hundreds of thousands of miliseconds faster in fact. I felt the modified quicksort with the help of insertion sort
would have the speed of the algorithm at O(nlogn) as desired.
